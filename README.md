# GC Star Wars API

https://swapi.dev/

# Intro

Welcome to the GC React Dev Challenge. You'll be building a small application manipulating the Star Wars API (swapi.dev). During this challenge we would like to see you exercise:

- Hooks
- Routing
- State manipulation
- Practices around coding standards & code structure
- Styling
- Version control (git)
- Write tests for your code
- Implement a responsive solution (works on mobile/tablet/desktop)

# Task

1. Call the swapi for all planets [https://swapi.dev/api/planets/](https://swapi.dev/api/planets/)
2. List out planets paginated listed with their name
3. Have a search bar to filter planets by name
4. When clicking a planet, push to a breakdown page that contains:
    1. The planets name in an editable text field limited to 10 characters
    2. The population as a slider
    3. Climate can be updated by checkboxes (options, can multi-select: 'Temperate', 'Arid', 'Tropical', 'Murky')
5. Buttons for cancel and submit, buttons can be same style but different colours
6. On submit, returning to the list page will reflect the updated details for the planet edited

**Bonus Points:** 

- Deploy (e.g. Heroku, Netlify)
- Use of some CSS preprocessor / library e.g. styled-components, SASS/SCSS if applicable
- Linting, code quality etc.
- Use of Persistence (local storage)

It's up to you to decide how far you want to go, time permitting
